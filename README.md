# Homados

**Total Time: 2h**

Homados is a diy bone conduncting headphones.

btw only Tier 2 highway project

## Goals
- design a pair of headphones that work
- use a pcb for controll
- design kind of like the openMoveShokz prob gonna be bulkier tho bc I am stupid 
- decent sound quality
- make it out of 3d printed materials like tpu and petg (bc I have a lot)
- what is inside it ( I am not confident I can even do any of this)
  - Transducer (this is the vibrating thingy)
  - Battery/Battery charging (this holds the power and adds more power)
  - Bluetooth/audo proccesing (this is what connects to your device and procces audio data)
  - control (the stuff that lets you turn it on/off or pause whatever you are listing to)
