# Homados

**Total Time: 6h**

Homados is a diy bone conduncting headphones.

btw only Tier 2 highway project

## Goals
- design a pair of headphones that work
- use a pcb for controll
- design kind of like the openMoveShokz prob gonna be bulkier tho bc I am stupid 
- decent sound quality
- make it out of 3d printed materials like tpu and petg (bc I have a lot)
- have a mic
- what is inside it ( I am not confident I can even do any of this)
  - Transducer (this is the vibrating thingy)
  - Battery/Battery charging (this holds the power and adds more power)
  - Bluetooth/audo proccesing (this is what connects to your device and procces audio data)
  - control (the stuff that lets you turn it on/off or pause whatever you are listing to)
   

## Parts
2x $9 [Bone Conductor Transducer](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1674)

Today I actually get to know what I am doing. for refrence I don't know how headphones work so I should be fineeeeeee. The PCB scares me. Idk how to make bluetooth but I can learn how to make smt for audio proccesing and solder on a bluetooth capable board.

Idea:
- what if I build a custom esp32 board but also build in all the aduio componets so one side is electronics adn the other side is battery and controll

Usefull Recoures:

I have found out more things I need on the pcb
- ESP32-S3
- external audio codec (idk wut this is yet) ES8388
- external PMIC (Power Management integrated circut)

I was working on getting an esp 32 working however now I was recomend a nrf52840 as a micro chip instead that is better at bluetooth

I found this could be usefull
[chip](https://www.amazon.com/FEASYCOM-QCC3024-Bluetooth-Analogue-certificated/dp/B09P1KBT1R/ref=sr_1_1?crid=YTJ1LJOLZBCK&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.q5R4eY0b_zg31FoP3KHEoLt_NgIi18yYPdU7yVwxmfM.vy3Ukh211L9wyJHB-zFAVqAV-oZc38_CDR6KyS1hU5k&dib_tag=se&keywords=QCC3040+TWS+Bluetooth+5.2+Audio+Module&qid=1749168789&s=electronics&sprefix=qcc3040+tws+bluetooth+5.2+audio+module%2Celectronics%2C69&sr=1-1-catcorr)

**Update:**
I am **Dumb** so turns out instead of spending hours learning electrical engineering I can just grab audio module with the stats I want and use it YAY

**Update 2:**
I am **Dumb** so turns out I am wrong if I want it to sound good I have to learn electrical enginnering 

**Time to decode this**
